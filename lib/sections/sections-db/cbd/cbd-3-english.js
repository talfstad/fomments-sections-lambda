        content: "To start I read many reviews, because I was curious. I've lived with chronic pain for years and haven't had a prescription yet that helped or even partially touched the pain. I was reading about Hemp oil, CBD oil etc. on Google and that got me started checking this item out. Most CBD oil is so expensive I couldn't buy it because that's a lot of money for something that might not work. I checked Amazon and they had it cheaper, but still expensive enough I didn't want to take the chance. When I came across PRODUCT_NAME it was so much less I started checking to find out what the difference was. I read the reviews and everyone was saying how much it helped. I decided to try it, even though I didnâ€™t expect to get much relief, but for the price what was there to lose, except pain. Well it's been six days since it arrived. I took one tablespoon that evening. Man, like drinking nutty oil, so I chased it with a piece of bread to get the taste out of my mouth. By morning I was feeling so much better. By that evening I noticed I didn't need a pain pill to help. By the third day I was able to sit up in bed without holding on to something. Today, the sixth day the pain in my legs, knees and hip joints is gone, but the clincher was the horrible pain in my lower back is almost gone. Swelling in my right hip is gone unless I get to active, then it becomes a dull ache. Best of all, I can sleep. I've been immobilized for several years, unable to do much for very long because I always had to sit back down. I was walking pitched forward to get around. Now I have to remember to straighten up. I not only look but I feel younger than my 72 years. No more pain pills for me. I'm so gitty over this I can't stop talking about it to my family and friends.",

I also suffer from nerve damage which creates severe pain down my left leg. My days had been just doing the bare minimum that needed to be done, and hitting the couch in a laying position by around 4pm and staying there until bed. After using this oil I started to feel less pain within days. Within a week I noticed that I actually cooked dinner 3 nights in a row. It has been less than a month and I can grocery shop by myself...my husband had to do the shopping for the past 7 years....and I don't go the couch until its time to watch the news around 7pm!! The nerve pain is far less in my leg. I find myself doing so much more than I did before. Do I still have pain? Yes, of course. But using this oil has decreased it by so much, and I feel useful again. I now have 4 sisters and my mother using it, too.",

The combo that I am seeing fantastic results with is this Hemp Oil and Vitamin E 70,000IU.(I have used others higher in dosage) My recipe is 1/4 cup Hemp Oil and 1/4 cup Vitamin E. I am happy. The last two days have been very painful with my Fibro and this morning I could barely move without immense pain. My husband applied the mix to my neck & upper back and within 15 minutes we left and spent the morning shopping. Now I did apply it again much later but probably did not need to but want to have a good nights sleep. So do your research, and check to see the difference between Hemp oil and CBD oil and find out what it can do for you. The taste is not great but it is not the worst tasting thing out there. This has been the best thing I have used yet.',
