They said to dose about the size of 1/2 a grain of rice, three times a day. I took one of my empty "0" pills and filled her up. In about a half hour.......I HAD TO GO TO BED!! No and\'s, if\'s, or but\'s.......I had, HAD to hit the hay. I slept straight for 6 hours, and it was the middle of the day. I was taking it to see if it had any effect on reducing my pain. I think so far it helped there too.....I\'ll let you know as time goes on. At least if you\'re having trouble sleeping.....this appears to be the ticket.',

After reading reviews for this, I had her sample it. The next time I saw her (two weeks later) she was swimming and cooking dinner, and moving around like normal!!!! She said she hadn't taken meds for several days but had been ingesting a teaspoon of oil everyday. I'm so happy I could cry, being able to see my mom normal again!!",
