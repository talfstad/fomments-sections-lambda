We are seven years apart, and so it causes some issues while I am energized and ready to explore the unknown he is very lethargic, forgetful, cloudy headed, and just not down for the do. THIS RIGHT HERE, changed all of that. He is LESS tired, He can remember a tad more than before (and anything at this point is good), he is alive in the bedroom. I just mix it in his smoothie for the day and off he goes. Id say I saw a change within 48-72 hours.',

Idk what it is but I havent been having any issue when its time to perform. Everything works like its supposed to and honestly, works a little better. lol. First time i took one pill a few hours before. The second time I took a pill a few hours before, then about an hour or so after taking the first, I opened a capsule and mixed half of it with a small glass of water and let me tell you....the stuffed worked perfectly. Im sure it affects everybody different but so far I have been happy with my purchase. Havent felt any side affects either. Great stuff.',
