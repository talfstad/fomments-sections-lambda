I found long ago that MUSCLE boosters are one of the single most important suppliments that I could take. I was puzzled that the prices became outrageous in my local vitamin store. I can tell you that PRODUCT_NAME works great and the price point is right where I want it to be. At 47 I ride as hard or harder than people in my spin class in their 20s and 30s. Don't believe me? Try something new this week. Get off the couch and try this booster for two months in conjunction with an exercise program of at least two of three sessions per week. You will see results and your muscle stamina will last longer. Good luck and God Bless. John 3:16",

If you never took this then i would take full dose with your pre-workout 30mints before your workout.. When you start your workout if you dont fill nothing dont worry wight an hour and then if dont fill it then next time you workout take full dose hour before NOW I MUST WARN YOU DO NO CARDIO OF ANY KIND when i use the full dose and just walk for 30 mints on the treadmill i felt light headed and my hart flutter...so becareful now the second time in full dose with no cardio i felt fine no issue with hart or light headed.. Just insane pumps and i saw my veins swell up for the first time . I have use many other pump products our there but this one is a 9.0 on a scale of 1 to 10 the price is what making a 9 good product but be careful if you are new to it',

        content: 'I have been using PRODUCT_NAME for a little over two weeks now and am so far happy with the product. Unlike pre-workout supplements that contain crazy stimulants, this does not give you any kind of jitters or energy from caffeine. But it does give you a noticeable increase in strength while working out. I began to feel the effects the second week of using the product. My bench, dead lift, and squats have all increased. I also feel like I have a bit more energy while lifting weights. The veins in my arms seem more pronounced while lifting and the "pump" is also increased. The capsules are very easy to take and have no after taste. I wish there was a dosage chart on the bottle to show if it is safer to take more. Overall, I am very happy with the product and would recommend it.',
